# FEDN Travels


## Introduction

This is a personal blog project to explore html and css skills. This is the submission for the first project as part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.


## Description

This is a personal travel blog to record my trips.

The blog consists of two pages:
- A main page to view a list of all posts
- A detailed post page

It contains a few basic links and shows ability to use HTML and CSS.



## Requirements:

The requirements for this project are as follows:
CSS Separate From HTML

Portfolio completely separates structure from design/style.
There are no attributes present in the body of the document.

CSS Imports

There should be at least 3 imported files in the main CSS file, but the student is welcome to break it down even further if that makes it easier for them.
